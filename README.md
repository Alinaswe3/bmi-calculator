## My process

### Built with

- Svelte JS
- Tailwind CSS
- Vite
- Typescript

### What I learned

While building this project I encountered many problems which gave me the opportunity to learn more about css, svelte
and web development in general. I finally understood some of the intermediate concepts of svelte.

### Continued development

I really want to focus on building and developing my CSS skills and my Svelte skills as I don't see my self coming back
to react soon. Since svelte doesn't really have a standard UI framework, I really want to learn CSS in order for me to
build my own cool UI components.

### Useful resources

- [ChatGPT](https://www.chat.openai.com) - This helped me remember some JS concepts that I forgot.
- [Svelte Docs](https://svelte.dev/) - The official svelte kit documents helped me understand how to use svelte
